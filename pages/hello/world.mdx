# Script - A Blank Script
This is a node named 'A Blank Script' which is a part of the 'Script' group. It is a blank script node designed to provide a starting point for creating custom scripts.

## How to use?
This node is a simple script that logs and returns a 'Hello' message. The script is written in JavaScript and it's designed to be asynchronous. It accepts a 'name' as an input and logs a greeting message. It doesn't use the input for anything, but it's there to demonstrate how you can pass inputs to your script. 

The script is as follows:
```javascript
export default async ({name},{logging}) => {
  logging.log(`Hello `)
  return `Hello `
}
```

## Inputs / Outputs
The node requires one input:

- `name`: A string value. This input doesn't affect the output of the script, it's just there for demonstration purposes.

**Example Input:**
```json
{
  "name": "John"
}
```

The node's output is a string with the value 'Hello'.

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "output": "Hello"
}
```
