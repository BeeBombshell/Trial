# Data Processing - CSV to JSON Converter
The CSV to JSON Converter node is a part of the Data Processing group. It is designed to transform CSV data into JSON format. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the data is initially in CSV format, but needs to be used in a system or application that requires JSON format.

## How to use?
The CSV to JSON Converter node operates by taking CSV data as input and converting it into JSON format. The conversion process is handled internally by the node script, making it simple and straightforward to use. 

## Inputs / Outputs
This node requires one input and provides one output.

**Input:** 
The input for this node is data in CSV format. Here is a sample CSV input:

```
Name, Age, Occupation
John, 30, Engineer
Jane, 28, Doctor
```

**Output:** 
The output of this node is data in JSON format. Following the above input example, the output would be:

```json
[
  {
    "Name": "John",
    "Age": "30",
    "Occupation": "Engineer"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Jane",
    "Age": "28",
    "Occupation": "Doctor"
  }
]
```
The JSON output can then be used in any system or application that requires data in JSON format.
